2.1.9/Apr 20, 2022
* Added new features in Ship Editor: Drag Mode and Rotation Mode, also bringing a slightly better look for button icons
* Two "features" have been added to the Starblast client:
- Non-capitalized names: You can use your name without a full uppercase name like before\n
- Chat emotes capacity is now increased to 5 instead of 4 like the original one
* MUST READ:
- Please note that SET has no intentions of becoming a hacking client. We've tried our best to add a new breeze to the game experience without accidentally introducing game-hacking features.\n
- Due to the restriction of the main Starblast Discord, please refrain from discussing the extension there. Although widely known and trusted by the community, this extension still hasn't received official recognition from the game developers.\n
- Since I'm currently struggling with uni stuff, I may be back at coding Starblast 1st POV in the middle of May. So stay tuned for new updates then!\n
- Thanks for reading this, and have a nice day with a blast in space! - Bhpsngum#2623
